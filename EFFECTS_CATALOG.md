* **Status:** ✅ Implemented
* **Pacing & Energy:** ⚡ High Energy / Pacing Reset
* **Visual Description:** A rapid, punchy cubic-eased camera zoom into a specific focal point on an image or document clip.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Pacing Reset (Pattern Interrupt):** When a scene or monologue has been talking for >3-4 seconds and viewer attention risks dropping.
  * **Script Twist / Dramatic Reveal:** When the narrator delivers a punchline, an accusation, or a shocking fact (e.g., *"and that's when the money vanished"*).
  * **Beat Sync:** Timed right on a drum kick, cymbal crash, or sub-bass drop to marry visuals to audio rhythm.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Never use two punch zooms back-to-back within <2.5 seconds (causes visual exhaustion/nausea).
  * Avoid punching into low-resolution assets where the crop exposes blurry pixelation.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Keywords: `suddenly`, `however`, `secret`, `the catch`, `shocking`, `millions`, `disaster`
  * Audio Cue: Sudden rise in voiceover pitch, audio pause followed by a harsh consonant, or drum impact.
* **How to Achieve in Magnates Studio (UI Recipe):**
  1. Add an image or video clip to the timeline.
  2. **Method A (Toolbar):** Select the **Punch Zoom Tool** (`tool-snap-zoom`) from the toolbar, then click on the exact point in the canvas preview where you want the camera to punch into.
  3. **Method B (Context Menu):** Right-click the clip on the timeline or canvas -> select **"Add Punch Zoom"**.
  4. **Fine-Tuning:** In the Inspector panel, adjust the target zoom scale (e.g. `1.5x` - `3.0x`), start time offset, and drag the visual crosshair target on the canvas.

* **Pacing & Energy:** ⚡ Cinematic / Hypnotic Retention Flow
* **Visual Description:** 
  * The outgoing image (Clip A) begins scaling forward towards the viewer with cinematic motion blur and radial speed lines.
  * **Crucial Overlap Dynamic:** Before Clip A disappears or finishes fading away, Clip B (the incoming image) emerges from deep center space (scale `0.45x`) and scales into full frame (`1.0x`).
  * Because the two images overlap seamlessly during the transition, the viewer experiences them not as two separate static pictures, but as a continuous forward camera voyage through layered space.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Seamless Scene Transitions:** Moving between two narrative beats, historical photos, or case-study evidence without breaking the visual spell.
  * **Retention Driving:** Eliminating hard jump cuts that cause viewers to look away or scroll.
  * **High-Budget Documentary Flow:** Emulating the signature visual pacing of Magnates Media, Vox, and Bloomberg documentary segments.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Avoid overusing on every single cut (limit to major topic transitions, chapter openings, or rhythmic vocal peaks every 6–10 seconds).
  * Ensure the incoming clip has enough resolution to avoid blur when scaling in.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Keywords: `next`, `meanwhile`, `behind closed doors`, `what happened next`, `then came`, `step two`
  * Visual Asset Type: Two adjacent archival photos, portrait-to-landscape transitions, stock chart to executive photo.
* **How to Achieve in Magnates Studio (UI Recipe):**
  * **1-Click Method (Instant Context Menu):** Right-click the incoming clip on the timeline -> click **"⚡ 3D Fly-Through Transition"**. It automatically applies the `0.7s` duration and pairs it with the `whoosh` procedural sound effect.
  * **2-Click Method (Timeline Transition Chip):** Click the purple **Transition Chip** situated between the two clips on the timeline -> select the **"⚡ 3D Fly-Through"** preset card -> Click **"Apply Transition"**.
  * **Inspector Method:** Select the incoming clip -> set `Transition` to `3D Fly-Through` -> set duration (`0.5s`–`1.2s`) and SFX to `whoosh`.

* **Status:** ✅ Implemented
* **Pacing & Energy:** ⚡ High Energy / Premium Aesthetic
* **Visual Description:** Massive kinetic typography placed physically behind a foreground person or object cutout, but in front of the background scene, creating instant high-budget 3D depth.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Footage Shortage / Abstract Concepts ("The B-Roll Filler"):** When the narrator talks about an abstract business strategy, philosophy, or internal scandal where no real video footage exists. It transforms a static stock portrait into a high-energy cinematic sequence.
  * **Chapter / Major Topic Introductions:** Opening hooks, thesis statements, or act transitions (e.g., *"Chapter 2: The Monopoly"*).
  * **Elevating Low-Budget Assets:** Turns ordinary static headshots into magazine-cover-style visual showstoppers.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Do not use for long sentences or paragraphs (>5-6 words). Depth text must be 1 to 4 punchy, high-impact words; otherwise it becomes illegible behind the subject.
  * Don't use if the foreground subject has wispy hair or blurry borders without clean AI cutout edges.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Script Structure: Sentence intros, video hooks (00:00 - 00:30), chapter titles, one-word thematic statements (`CORRUPTION`, `MONOPOLY`, `THE COLLAPSE`).
* **How to Achieve in Magnates Studio (UI Recipe):**
  1. Add a photo or cutout clip to the timeline.
  2. Right-click the image clip -> select **"Remove Background" (AI Cutout)** so the subject is isolated with transparency.

* **Status:** ✅ Implemented
* **Pacing & Energy:** 🎨 Stylized Documentary / Playful Satire
* **Visual Description:** Takes an isolated subject and renders a crisp, bold multi-pass white and dark outline contour around the silhouette, evoking a tangible paper cutout or documentary graphic novel aesthetic.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Separation From Cluttered Backgrounds:** When the subject blends into a busy or dark backdrop and needs an instant pop to stand out.
  * **Satirical / Critical Tone:** Giving CEOs, politicians, or business moguls a slightly stylized, animated comic-book/puppet caricature feel.
  * **Collage Storytelling:** When assembling multiple elements onto the screen simultaneously (e.g., money stacks, company logos, and an executive's cutout).
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Avoid when the video aims for a strictly somber, tragic, or hyper-photorealistic cinematic tone where stylized comic borders feel inappropriate.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Tone: Irony, corporate exposes, satirical bios, playful comparisons (`versus`, `competitors`, `the CEO`).
* **How to Achieve in Magnates Studio (UI Recipe):**
  1. Select any transparent cutout or image clip.
  2. Right-click the clip -> select **"Magnates Vector / Paper Cutout"**.

  * Do not animate every single word in a sentence; highlight only the 1-2 words that carry emotional weight.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Sentence structure: Interrogative hooks (*"Why did...?"*, *"How does...?"*), quantifiable claims (*"$42 Billion"*, *"80% drop"*), and key quotes.
* **Supported Styles:**
  * `pop`: Bouncy scale pop on arrival with focal red/cyan drop shadow. Best for punchy single words or keywords.
  * `slide_up` / `slide_down` / `slide_left` / `slide_right`: Directional smooth camera glide. Best for questions and quotes.
  * `zoom_in`: Dramatic scale from `0.2` to `1.0`. Best for startling revelations.

### 4.1 Progressive Dual-Line & Area Spread Chart ("Cost Per Lead / Click")

![Dynamic Dual-Line Area Chart](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/antigravity/noble-bell/docs/assets/templates/dynamic_area_chart.png)
![Cost Per Click Downward Draw](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/antigravity/noble-bell/docs/assets/templates/cost_per_click_drop.png)

* **System ID:** `fx-dynamic-area-chart` / `line_area_draw`
* **Industry & Creator Aliases:** Trim Path Line Draw, Dynamic Area Fill, Gap Comparison Chart, Vox Metrics Sweep
* **Visual Description:** 
  * A continuous line graph starts with zero length and progressively draws itself from left to right across the canvas following a custom easing curve.
  * Individual data node dots scale up in sequence as the leading edge of the stroke crosses their X coordinates.
  * Beneath the curve, a semi-transparent monochrome or accent gradient fill unmasks simultaneously (or cascades downward) to reveal the volume/area.
  * When showing two comparative curves (e.g. baseline vs. current), the shaded area between both curves dynamically shrinks or expands, exposing the "distance" or delta between the metrics.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Revealing Trends Over Time:** When narrating a timeline (e.g., *"between January and November, acquisition costs plummeted"*). The line draw paces the narration word-for-word.
  * **Cost Drops & Disasters:** Highlighting a sharp falloff or cliff in metrics (e.g. CAC dropping to zero or revenue collapsing).
  * **Comparative Spreads:** Emphasizing margin or discrepancy between two competing figures.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Do not display all data points instantaneously like a static slide; without the progressive write-on, the viewer's eyes wander before the speaker delivers the takeaway.
  * Do not use overly erratic or chaotic line jitter that makes the overarching directional trend ambiguous.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Keywords: `cost per lead`, `cost per click`, `margin`, `dropped by`, `fell off a cliff`, `gap widened`, `over the course of months`
  * Visual Asset Type: Time-series tables, financial reports, Google/Meta Ads dashboards.
* **How to Achieve this Effect (Plain-Text Guide & Recipes):**
  * **In Magnates Studio (Pre-built Template):**
    1. Open the **Templates** tab -> **Infographics** -> select **"Dynamic Area Spread"**.
    2. Enter or paste your numerical data points (or select presets like *Steep Decline*, *Volatile Growth*, *Dual Comparison*).
    3. Set `Draw Duration` (default: `1.8s` with `cubic_bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` easing).
    4. Enable `Area Fill Gradient` and adjust fill opacity (`0.15` to `0.40`).
    5. Check `Animate Node Points` to automatically spawn bouncing indicator dots on each coordinate.
  * **In Video Editors (After Effects / Premiere):**
    1. Draw your line path using the Pen Tool on a Shape Layer.
    2. Add **Trim Paths** -> keyframe `End` from `0%` to `100%`. Set Easy Ease (`F9`) and pull the graph velocity handle forward for a snappy ramp-down.
    3. Duplicate the shape layer, close the path to the bottom axis baseline, and add a Fill with a Vertical Linear Gradient.
    4. Add a **Linear Wipe** (Angle: 90°) to the fill layer and link its completion percentage to the Trim Path `End` keyframe via an expression (`linear(value, 0, 100, 100, 0)`).
  * **In Code / Web (SVG + CSS/JS):**
    1. Compute total path length via `SVGPathElement.getTotalLength()`.
    2. Set `stroke-dasharray: length` and animate `stroke-dashoffset` from `length` to `0`.
    3. Apply an SVG `<clipPath>` bounding rectangle that animates its `width` from `0` to `100%` across the duration.

### 4.2 Staggered Metric Bar Pop-Up ("Conversion Rate")

![Staggered Metric Bar Pop-Up](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/antigravity/noble-bell/docs/assets/templates/staggered_bar_chart.png)

* **System ID:** `fx-staggered-bar` / `bar_stagger_pop`
* **Industry & Creator Aliases:** Kinetic Bar Chart, Sequential Growth Bars, Neon Pillar Reveal
* **Visual Description:**
  * Clean vertical columns/bars emerge from a grounded zero baseline, rising smoothly one by one with a slight staggered delay (e.g. 60ms between each column).
  * Bars possess a signature high-visibility neon accent color (e.g., lime green `#76ff03` or neon cyan `#00f0ff`) against a dark matte background.
  * The peak bar (or the target milestone month) triggers an intensified luminous outer glow or scale pulse when reached.
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Categorical / Monthly Growth:** Showing progression from bad to great (e.g., *"our conversion rate climbed steadily every month until peaking in October"*).
  * **Leaderboard Comparison:** Comparing multiple companies, products, or channels side-by-side.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Avoid animating all bars upward in unison; it lacks rhythm and fails to direct the viewer through the narrative progression.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Keywords: `conversion rate`, `monthly breakdown`, `soared`, `peaked at`, `month after month`, `consistently climbed`
  * Visual Asset Type: Bar graphs, quarterly revenue comparisons, conversion funnel steps.
* **How to Achieve this Effect (Plain-Text Guide & Recipes):**
  * **In Magnates Studio (Pre-built Template):**
    1. Select **Templates** -> **Infographics** -> **"Staggered Bar Reveal"**.
    2. Input month labels (`Jan` through `Dec`) and values.
    3. Choose bar highlight palette (e.g. *Neon Lime*, *Cyber Cyan*, *Electric Amber*).
    4. Set `Stagger Delay` (default: `0.08s` per bar) and `Growth Easing` (`spring_soft` or `cubic_ease_out`).
    5. Check `Highlight Peak Bar` to automatically apply outer bloom glow to the maximum value.
  * **In Video Editors (After Effects):**
    1. Set the anchor point of each bar shape layer to its bottom center.
    2. Animate `Scale Y` from `0%` to `100%` with an easing curve like `easeOutBack` (overshoot `105%` before settling to `100%`).
    3. Shift each layer in the timeline forward by 3 to 5 frames sequentially (Sequence Layers).
    4. Add a Glow effect (Glow Radius: `40`, Intensity: `0.8`) on an adjustment layer or applied directly to the top bar.

### 4.3 Liquid Wave & Glowing Funnel / Pyramid ("3% Buying Now")

![Liquid Wave Glowing Pyramid](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/antigravity/noble-bell/docs/assets/templates/liquid_glowing_pyramid.png)

* **System ID:** `fx-liquid-pyramid` / `wave_funnel_glow`
* **Industry & Creator Aliases:** Hormozi Funnel Pyramid, Organic Wave Fill, Buyer Hierarchy Tier, Neon Liquid Slog
* **Visual Description:**
  * A geometric segmented shape (such as a 4-tier buyer pyramid, market hierarchy triangle, or conversion funnel).
  * Instead of a rigid straight divider, the active metric color sloshes and rolls with an **organic fluid wave / liquid meniscus** that rises up into the tier.
  * As the liquid reaches its resting level, a luminous neon rim or ambient bloom radiates outward along the boundary, pulling immediate focus to the percentage or headline text (e.g., *"3% BUYING NOW"*).
* **🎯 Editorial Intent & When to Use:**
  * **Market Segmentation / Hierarchy:** Explaining audience proportions (e.g. Hormozi's famous *"The 3% who are ready to buy right now vs. the 97% who are not"*).
  * **Liquid Thresholds:** Illustrating filling capacity, goal attainment, or energy levels with visceral physical motion.
* **⚠️ When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns):**
  * Don't let the liquid wave cycle continuously at high speed during serious narration, as constant churning distracts from the core text reading. Let it settle into a calm, gentle breathing pulse.
* **🤖 AI Narrative & Script Triggers:**
  * Keywords: `pyramid`, `the top 3%`, `funnel`, `tier`, `hierarchy`, `majority of customers`, `only a fraction`, `ready to buy`
  * Visual Asset Type: Funnels, marketing pyramids, maslow hierarchy diagrams, percentage split graphics.
* **How to Achieve this Effect (Plain-Text Guide & Recipes):**
  * **In Magnates Studio (Pre-built Template):**
    1. Select **Templates** -> **Infographics** -> **"Liquid Pyramid Tier"**.
    2. Choose tier level (e.g. `Tier 1: Top Apex`, `Tier 2: Mid Upper`, `Tier 3: Base`).
    3. Input typography overlay (`"3% BUYING NOW"`).
    4. Select accent fill color (`#B4FF00` Neon Chartreuse).
    5. Set `Wave Agitation` (slosh amplitude) and `Liquid Rise Time` (`1.2s`).
    6. Enable `Active Tier Bloom` for the neon perimeter glow.
  * **In Video Editors (After Effects):**
    1. Create the pyramid base vector shape with gray fill (`#333333`).
    2. Duplicate the top segment into a new layer with bright lime color (`#B4FF00`).
    3. Create a wave layer beneath it using a horizontal path with wavy bezier curves, or apply the **Wave Warp** effect (Wave Type: Sine, Wave Height: `18`, Wave Width: `120`, Direction: `0°`).
    4. Animate the Y-position of the wave mask rising up from bottom to top of the tier.
    5. Set the lime tier layer's Track Matte to the pyramid apex mask so the wave is strictly confined inside the triangle.
    6. Apply **Glow / Deep Glow** to the apex layer with a soft feather.

## 🏛️ James Jani FTX 3D Kinetic Logo Builder & Shockwave Reveal

### Overview & Narrative Intent
* **System ID:** `jani-ftx-logo-reveal`
* **Industry & Creator Aliases:** James Jani Logo Builder, 3D Block Deconstruction, FTX Wavy Boom Reveal, Kinetic Logo Assembly
* **Status:** ✅ Implemented
* **Pacing & Energy:** ⚡ High Tension & Climactic Brand Reveal
* **Visual Description:** 
  The signature 3D title reveal from James Jani's famous FTX documentary (*"FTX - The $32 Billion Fraud"*). The iconic logo begins deconstructed into separate 3D geometric slabs tumbling in a deep dark void with cyan fog. A large rectangular slab rolls onto itself and drifts into the background while smaller electric-blue and white companion cubes float across the scene. The slab spins into camera, charges with an intense cyan flare, and dims sharply. At peak tension, it detonates an expanding **"wavy boom" shockwave** that physically ripples through space, wobbling the companion cubes with sinusoidal kinetic waves. All blocks then magnetically arrest their momentum and snap cleanly into the FTX glyph emblem alongside bold 3D extruded white typography (**"FTX"**) and glowing subtitle (**"THE GREAT FRAUD"**).

### 5-Phase Choreography Timeline
1. **Phase 1: The Tumble & Drift (0.0s – 1.8s):**
   * Large top slab rolls on itself along X/Y axes and recedes into depth.
   * White and cyan cubes drift right-to-left across the midground.
   * Materials remain matte/metallic with dark titanium bevels.
2. **Phase 2: The Charge, Flare & Sudden Dim (1.8s – 2.4s):**
   * Central slab rotates toward the camera and surges in emissive brightness (up to 4.5x bloom).
   * Right at peak tension, it suddenly dims down to 0.15 for maximum contrast anticipation.
3. **Phase 3: The Wavy Boom & Kinetic Ripple (2.4s – 4.0s):**
   * Concentric 3D shockwave rings blast radially from the center with glowing cyan bloom.
   * Invisible pressure wave sweeps past the floating companion cubes, causing violent sinusoidal wave oscillation (position wobble & rotational ripple).
   * Central slab executes a full 360° axial spin.
4. **Phase 4: Magnetic Convergence & Logo Assembly (4.0s – 5.6s):**
   * All 4 blocks snap into the exact proportions of the FTX glyph with cubic-eased magnetic inertia.
   * 3D extruded white letters **"FTX"** rush forward from depth and lock into position with specular glare.
   * Subtitle **"THE GREAT FRAUD"** fades up with letter-spacing tracking.
5. **Phase 5: Hero Hold (5.6s – 7.0s+):**
   * Full lockup gently floats in the dark void with floor reflections and ambient drifting dust motes.
